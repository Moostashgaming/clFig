# clFig

A tool to collect user configuration preferences and store them, all on the command line. <br>
This really should only be used for simple config schemes (The current design goal) where the program is taking in a few simple values <br>
This could either be used in place of flags or for easy flag persistance. <br>
Mostly this isn't all that useful but it uses a novel way of storing configs that's optimized to be as tiny as possible.
