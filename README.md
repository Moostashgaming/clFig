A tool to make configuration easy by providing both an assist and interactive mode to create configs. <br>

### Usage (Once actually functional)
#### Interactive Mode:

Using the program in interactive mode is quite easy. <br>
Simply run the program and answer the questions given to you.

#### Assist Mode:

Usage in assist mode is a little more complicated, yet still relatively simple. <br>
Upon running the program you will be met with a text editor, with options for configuration displayed above your cursor. <br>
The program will in essence walk you through how to write your config, showing you each possible option at every step. <br>

### Coming Soon

- A working program
- More complexity (Adding support for logic, etc.)
